C++ practice that Implement  STDL ALGORITHMS  with help of FUNCTORS and LAMDAS
Three class  :
   file STL_Class.h - declare and define functors. 
   class Test_STL.cpp  - main function , uses STL algorithms and uses functor from  STL_Class.h and Lambdas.

COMPILATION use command: $make          

RUNNING use command: $ make run or ./file.exe  

CLEANING use command: $make clean  # clean    

OUTPUT - printed on the command line.
